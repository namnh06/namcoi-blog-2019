== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I stop Ad Blockerer users? =
NO! This plugin does not completly block Ad Blockerer users, it only uses a passive approach, and it will always be that way.

= Is it working with Google Adsense Ads? =
Yes, and probably with all kinf of content hidden by an Ad Blockerer software.

= Is it compatible with caching systeme =
Yes it is. Depend on parameters...

= The plugin is activated and setting up, but nothing append. =
First check if the "Random selectors and files" option is checked.
Then purge all cache and rebuild your minify, then check again.
You can also try to open a new private tab to have a new "clean" test environment.
If you don't have any caching/minify plugin, it is mostly due to your theme which does not contain the required wp_footer() function in the footer.php file.

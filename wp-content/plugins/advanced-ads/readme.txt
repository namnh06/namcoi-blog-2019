== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to put ads on WordPress? =

You can use Advanced Ads to insert ads into your WordPress site without any coding.

To get started, just take a look at 

* the [general first ad tutorial](https://wpadvancedads.com/manual/first-ad/) 
* using [AdSense Auto ads](https://wpadvancedads.com/adsense-auto-ads-wordpress/) in WordPress 
* the [AdSense overview page](https://wpadvancedads.com/adsense-ads).
* Ads not showing up? Take a look [here](https://wpadvancedads.com/manual/ads-not-showing-up).

= What about my users’ privacy and GDPR? =

You can show ads only to visitors that give their consent. See [GDPR support](https://wpadvancedads.com/manual/ad-cookie-consent/).

Advanced Ads itself does neither save personal information (e.g., an IP address) in your database nor cookies in the visitor’s browser.

Third party services like Google Analytics are disabled by default.

You can learn more about how Advanced Ads and its add-ons handles data and privacy of your visitors [on this page](https://wpadvancedads.com/manual/privacy-information-for-users/).

= Which ad networks are supported? =

Advanced Ads is compatible with all ad networks and banners from affiliate programs like Google AdSense, Chitika, Clickbank, Amazon, and also Google Ad Manager (Google Double Click, DFP), media.net.

You can also use it to insert additional ad network tags into header or footer of your site without coding.

AdSense has even a dedicated ad type leveling the specific options this ad network provides.

= PHP functions and shortcodes =

You can use functions and shortcodes to display ads and ad groups.

The integers in this example are the IDs of the elements.

Use these shortcodes to insert an ad or group into your post/page.

`[the_ad id="24"]`
`[the_ad_group id="5"]`

Use these functions to insert an ad or ad group into your template file.

`<?php the_ad(24); ?>`
`<?php the_ad_group(5); ?>`

In addition to directly displaying ads and groups you can define ad placements and assign either an ad or group to them.

`[the_ad_placement id="header-left"]`
`<?php the_ad_placement('header-left'); ?>`

= Is there a revenue share? =

There is no revenue share. Advanced Ads doesn’t alter your ad codes in a way that you earn less than you would directly including the ad code in your template.

= Can I place ads directly in my theme files? =

Yes. I would add a "Manual" placement into your theme files. It would allow you to change the displayed ads or groups later without changing your code again.

= Does it work with other ad plugins? =

Yes. Advanced Ads can be combined with other ad plugins. 
Just use their shortcodes in our "Rich Media" ad type to combine both features.
Works with AdRotate, Ad Inserter, Ad Injection, Quick AdSense, Quick AdSense Reloaded (WPQUADS), Simple Ads Manager, and other plugins.

= Can I use Flash ads? =

There is a dedicated Flash ad type in [Pro](https://wpadvancedads.com/add-ons/advanced-ads-pro/).

= Is the plugin compatible with page builders? =

Yes. It works out of the box with all site builders that allow shortcodes or widgets, like Elementor, SiteOrigin, Beaver Builder, WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer), and others.
There is also a [free add-on to support the WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ads-for-visual-composer/).

= Will ads show up for ad block users? =

Visitors who have any ad blocker (e.g., AdBlock Plus) enabled won’t see ads from known external sources (e.g., AdSense).
You can still monetize those spots with custom content.

Read more about ad blockers and the features Advanced Ads has to deal with them [on this page](https://wpadvancedads.com/manual/ad-blockers/).

= I am a developer. Can I customize the plugin? =

Yes. Advanced Ads is based on WordPress standards and therefore easily customizable using either WordPress hooks or the ones we defined [here](https://wpadvancedads.com/codex/).

== Screenshots ==

1. Placements that let you inject ads anywhere into your site without coding (7 in Advanced Ads + 14 through add-ons).
